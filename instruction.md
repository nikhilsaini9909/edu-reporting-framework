# Educational Analytics Reporting Framework

## Project Overview
The Educational Analytics Reporting Framework is a comprehensive system designed to collect, store, and analyze user interactions and performance metrics from the Whiteboard and Notebook applications, with special focus on Quiz features. This system will provide valuable insights to educators, administrators, and product managers to improve educational outcomes.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket/Socket.io
- **API Architecture**: REST APIs
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Data Collection & Processing
#### 1.1 Data Collection
- Event-based tracking system for user interactions
- REST API endpoints for data submission
- WebSocket connections for real-time quiz interactions
- Comprehensive metadata logging for all interactions

#### 1.2 Data Processing
- Event categorization and normalization
- Metric calculation and aggregation
- Efficient data storage in Supabase
- Data validation and sanitization

#### 1.3 Reporting & Analytics
- RESTful API endpoints for report generation
- Real-time dashboard updates via WebSockets

### 2. Data Storage
- Efficient data organization in Supabase
- Optimized table structure for quick queries
- Data archival and retention policies

### 3. API Implementation
- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User authentication
  - Data submission
  - Report generation
  - Analytics retrieval
- JWT-based authentication system
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - Admin roles
  - Teacher roles
  - Student roles

### 4. Real-time Features
- WebSocket implementation for:
  - Live quiz interactions
  - Real-time analytics updates
  - Instant notifications
